### Backend Development

```python
# Example: Clean API endpoint implementation
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Depends
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from typing import List, Optional
import logging

app = FastAPI()
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

@app.post("/api/users/", response_model=UserResponse)
async def create_user(
    user_data: UserCreate,
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_admin_user)
):
    try:
        # Validate input data
        if await user_exists(db, user_data.email):
            raise HTTPException(400, "User already exists")

        # Create user with proper validation
        db_user = create_user_record(db, user_data)
        logger.info(f"User created: {db_user.id}")

        return UserResponse.from_orm(db_user)
    except ValidationError as e:
        logger.error(f"Validation error: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(422, str(e))
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(500, "Internal server error")
```

### Algorithm Implementation

```python
# Example: Efficient algorithm with proper complexity analysis
def find_longest_common_subsequence(text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
    """
    Find length of longest common subsequence using dynamic programming.
    Time Complexity: O(m * n)
    Space Complexity: O(min(m, n)) with space optimization
    """
    if not text1 or not text2:
        return 0

    # Ensure text1 is the shorter string for space optimization
    if len(text1) > len(text2):
        text1, text2 = text2, text1

    m, n = len(text1), len(text2)

    # Use rolling array to optimize space
    prev = [0] * (m + 1)
    curr = [0] * (m + 1)

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            if text2[i-1] == text1[j-1]:
                curr[j] = prev[j-1] + 1
            else:
                curr[j] = max(prev[j], curr[j-1])

        prev, curr = curr, prev

    return prev[m]
```

### Database Operations

```python
# Example: Robust database operations with proper error handling
class UserRepository:
    def __init__(self, db_session: Session):
        self.db = db_session

    async def create_user(self, user_data: UserCreate) -> User:
        try:
            # Start transaction
            db_user = User(
                email=user_data.email.lower(),
                hashed_password=hash_password(user_data.password),
                created_at=datetime.utcnow()
            )

            self.db.add(db_user)
            await self.db.commit()
            await self.db.refresh(db_user)

            return db_user
        except IntegrityError:
            await self.db.rollback()
            raise UserAlreadyExistsError("User with this email already exists")
        except Exception as e:
            await self.db.rollback()
            logger.error(f"Database error creating user: {e}")
            raise DatabaseError("Failed to create user")

    async def get_user_by_email(self, email: str) -> Optional[User]:
        return await self.db.query(User).filter(
            User.email == email.lower(),
            User.is_active == True
        ).first()
```

    }

    // Prepare request
    requestBody, err := json.Marshal(payment)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to marshal payment request: %w", err)
    }

    // Make API call with retry logic
    response, err := p.makeRequest(ctx, "POST", "/payments", requestBody)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("payment API call failed: %w", err)
    }

    var paymentResponse PaymentResponse
    if err := json.Unmarshal(response, &paymentResponse); err != nil {
