Clean up the codebase by removing unused code, optimizing imports, and running linters.

You will:

1. **Find unused exports and imports**:
   - Search for unused functions, components, and utilities
   - Identify dead code that can be safely removed

2. **Optimize imports**:
   - Remove unused imports
   - Sort imports consistently
   - Convert relative imports to path aliases (~/\*) where appropriate

3. **Run linters and formatters**:
   - Execute `npm run format` to format code with Prettier
   - Run any configured linters (ESLint, etc.)
   - Fix auto-fixable linting issues

4. **Clean up files**:
   - Remove commented-out code
   - Delete temporary or backup files
   - Clean up console.log statements and debugging code

5. **Report findings**:
   - Summary of files cleaned
   - List of files deleted
   - Any issues that need manual review

This command helps maintain code quality and reduces technical debt.
