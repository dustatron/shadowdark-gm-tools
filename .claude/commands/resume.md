You are resuming work on an ongoing project. Follow these steps:

1. **Assess current state**:
   - Check git status to see what files have been modified
   - Review recent commits to understand what was last worked on
   - Check for any TODO comments or incomplete work in modified files
   - Look for any existing todo list items that need attention

2. **Gather context**:
   - Read any relevant plan files in `/context/plans/` directory
   - Review recent changes to understand the current implementation state
   - Identify what remains to be completed

3. **Present a summary** to the user:
   - What was being worked on (based on recent commits and changes)
   - Current progress and state
   - What tasks remain to be completed
   - Recommended next steps

4. **Ask for confirmation** before proceeding with any work

5. **Use parallel delegation** when appropriate:
   - If multiple independent tasks remain, offer to delegate them to specialized agents
   - Use the Task tool with multiple agents in parallel for efficiency
   - Coordinate dependent tasks sequentially

Your goal is to help the user seamlessly continue where they left off with full context and clear next steps.
