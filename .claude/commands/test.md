Run tests and fix any failures using the test-engineer agent.

You will:

1. Execute the test suite using `npm run test` or appropriate test command
2. Analyze any test failures or errors
3. Use the test-engineer agent to fix failing tests or improve test coverage
4. Re-run tests to verify fixes

If no test command exists, notify the user and offer to help set up testing infrastructure.
